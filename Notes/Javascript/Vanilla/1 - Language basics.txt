    Javascript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented computer programming language
     
    Methods for adding javscript to a page:
    
        -Inline script
            <script>
                console.log('Hi!');
            </script>
        -Separate file
            <link rel...... </link>

    Variables and declarations:

        Let and const have big advantage in means of block level scope.

        VAR::
            Var and let are reassignable.

                var name = 'Funky John';
                name = "Another Name";

            Initialization:

                var x;

            This sets the variable to undefined.
        LET
        CONST
            Constants cannot be reassigned. We have to provide a value at the
            declaration.

            const name = 'Peter Petigrew'
            console.log(name);

            name = 'Jani'; will throw an error.

            A tricky part is if you for example declare a const array which contains
            objects. The objects themselves can be modified, but the reference
            cannot be reassigned, it must point to the same object.

            This also works.

                const number = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
                numbers.push(7);

            This however does not!

                number = [1,2,3]; --> this is a whole new entitiy, not a mutation
            

    Rules and conventions:

        -Variable names can include numbers, letters, _ and $ sign.
        -Variable names cannot start with numbers.
