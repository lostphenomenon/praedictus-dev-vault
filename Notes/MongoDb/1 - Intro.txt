Types of NoSQL:

     1. Column Store - Cassandra
          Primarily used for BI purposes.
          Each column is stored in a different table
          Selecting is fast, insert update etc is very slow.

     2. Key value store - Redis
          Like one table with 2 columns
          In this example if you know the post id, you can get everything related.
          Fast mapping.

          Key:                             Value:
               {PostId}.Title                "Mongo"
               {PostId}.Text                 "RndText"
               {PostId}.Comments             ["12313,123123,12313]
               {PostId}.{CommentId}.Text      "Hello! It was nice!"

     3. Document store - Mongo
          Similar to a key-value store, but everything is stored in JSON, but a value can also be another document.

     4. GraphStore - Neo4j
          it only stores relations, its hard to call it noSQL because it not non-relational

     5. Search Engines - Elastic Search
          anything can be used as a database under them, they analize the data, frequency etc. via selects
          they can be used in combination with NoSQL databases

When to use them::

     - When you want to use a code-first approach.
     - In conjunction with "simple" systems. (eg. webapps etc.)
